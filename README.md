# Mean-boilerplate
MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.

## Prerequisite Technologies
### Linux
* *Node.js* - <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">Download</a> and Install Node.js, nodeschool has free <a href=" http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers">node tutorials</a> to get you started.
* *MongoDB* - <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">Download</a> and Install mongodb - <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual">Checkout their manual</a> if you're just starting.
